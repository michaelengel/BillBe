# BillBe
BillBe is an (incomplete) Hobbit BeBox emulator originally written by Coraline Sherratt (csherratt).

Modifications to enable compilation with current Rust (rustc 1.70.0-nightly)

BillBe can currently start two known kernels:
- Be Labradors Kernel version of Mar  1 1994 time 14:53:41
- Be Labradors Kernel version of Nov 23 1994 time 12:11:01

Both kernels crash due to illegal memory accesses in the emulated kernel code - this is most certainly an emulator bug.
